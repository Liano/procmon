# procmon

system process provider Based on [YoniKF/process-iterator](https://github.com/YoniKF/process-iterator)
The program is still under development, I intend to use this application as project for learning Rust programming language with winapi create as main objective.

For the time being only Windows is supported but I intend to also support linux and McOS X.

Suggestions and comments are welcome.
